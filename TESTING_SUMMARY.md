## 🐛 Known Issues & Required Fixes

### High Priority

#### 1. Frontend Test Type Errors
**File**: `src/lib/api.test.ts`, `src/components/ProjectList.test.tsx`

**Issues**:
- API method signatures don't match actual implementation
  - `createSession` - needs correct parameters
  - `deleteSession` - doesn't exist (should use session management API)
  - `listMCPServers` - incorrect signature
  - `detectClaudeBinary` - doesn't exist

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Update test mocks to match actual API signatures from src/lib/api.ts
// Reference: Lines 470-1600 in api.ts for correct method signatures
```

#### 2. Project Type Mismatch
**Issue**: Test mocks use `name` field but Project type doesn't have it

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Check actual Project type definition and update mocks:
type Project = {
  id: string;
  path: string;
  // Verify other fields from actual type definition
};
```

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Missing Test Coverage
- Settings component tests
- Agents component tests
- MCP Manager component tests
- Custom hooks tests
- Context providers tests

#### 4. E2E Test Implementation
- Use Playwright MCP to test complete workflows
- Test session creation and execution flow
- Test agent creation and execution
- Test MCP server configuration
- Test file picker and project selection
